// BACKUP of working logic for StructuralSleevePlacementCommand.cs before further refactoring for view-based/crop filtering.
// Restore this file if you need to revert to the last known working logic.

// The full backup should be a verbatim copy of the original file, including all using statements, namespace, class, and method bodies.
// If you need to restore, copy the entire file content from the main StructuralSleevePlacementCommand.cs.
